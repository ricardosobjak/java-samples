 * The java HashMap class does not guarantee that the order will remain constant

 * basic operations (get and put), assuming the hash function disperses the
 * elements properly among the buckets. The HashMap implementation is not
 * synchronized. If multiple threads access this map concurrently, and at least
 * one of the threads modifies the map structurally, it must be synchronized
 * externally. To prevent unsynchronized access to the Map: Map m =
 * Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap(ï¿½));
